"""Standard-library web front end for live ns-3 simulations.

All simulation logic lives in Python (this module and ``web_plugins``). The
browser only renders the JSON it receives and posts user actions back.

How it runs
-----------

``start()`` is called by the scenario after it builds its topology (or by
``VisualSimulatorImpl`` when a C++ program runs with the visualizer). It
attaches a ``Visualizer`` to the simulation, then blocks in an HTTP server
bound to 127.0.0.1 on a random port.

The simulation is advanced by the browser's polls of ``/api/state``. Each
poll runs the simulator for the wall-clock time elapsed since the previous
step multiplied by ``speed`` (capped at ``MAX_STEP_WALL``), so ``speed`` is
simulated seconds per wall-clock second regardless of how often the page
polls or how long a step takes. Pausing is just "poll without advancing".

Threading
---------

The server is single threaded and runs on the thread that called
``start()``, which is also the thread that built the topology. ns-3 is not
thread safe, and Simulator::Run() records its caller as the main thread:
Schedule() then asserts when called from any other thread, so every request
(stepping, enabling the flow monitor, setting attributes, the console) must
run on that one thread.

``Visualizer.lock`` (re-entrant) is kept so plugins or user threads that touch
ns-3 can serialize with request handling.

HTTP API
--------

GET  /                        page (index.html with the session token)

GET  /api/state               advance one step, return the scene snapshot
GET  /api/types               TypeId catalogue (attributes, traces, methods)
GET  /api/objects?node=N      object tree root for node N
GET  /api/objects?id=X        one object of the tree, expanded lazily
